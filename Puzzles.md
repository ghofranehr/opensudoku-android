### Get more puzzles ###

OpenSudoku can now open several sudoku file formats directly from web. Just click any link below and folder with puzzles will be downloaded and imported directly into the OpenSudoku.

### Puzzles generated by gnome-sudoku ###

These puzzles were generated by [gnome-sudoku](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeSudoku) - same generator was used to create original puzzles in game. Please note that these puzzles are rather easy.

**2009-09-16** - I've generated new puzzles as previous puzzles here were wrong (all files contained one identical set of hard puzzles). Sorry for the inconvenience.
